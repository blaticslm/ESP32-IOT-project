## ESP32 to Arduino program

ESP32's pwm somehow was not recognized by the server motors(may be the frequency was too high). ***Arduino was used to take ESP32 pwm as analog pins input***. Smoothing the PWM signal into analog signal needed the capacitor. Capacitor should be as big as possible (this project used 100uF capacitors). Here is some advantage for using larger capacitor:
- Less voltage rippling 
- Faster charging time
- Thus, the smoothed PWM signal can be viewed by Arduino as analog signal input like constant 5V

Here is the diagram beforeðŸŸ¦ and afterðŸŸ¥ smoothing the pwm

## Future improvement
- Android app for this application
- Modify the naming of the program to make it more readable
